READ_ME - Køge Bugt North, Køge Bugt Central, and Køge Bugt South Terminus Positions (2022-2024) 

The following dataset represents the shapefiles associated with a manuscript to be submitted to 'Geophysical Research Letters' entitled 'Multi-year ice dynamics at Køge Bugt Central glacier controlled by bed topography'. 

Each shapefile reflects a terminus position manually digitised using Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 images downloaded using the USGS Earth Explorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). Where suitable optical imagery was unavailable, MEaSUREs Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mosaics were employed, downloaded from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC; Joughin, 2021).

The dataset comprises 71 terminus positions in total, each digitised from imagery collected between 11/01/2022 and 08/12/2023.

The following information is provided for each digitised terminus position: 
1. IMAGE_ID - The image ID of the Landsat-8, Landsat-9 or SAR mosaic from which the associated terminus position was manually digitised.
2. DATE - The specific date on which the imagery from which the associated terminus position was manually digitised was captured.
3. SOURCE - The website from which the Landsat-8, Landsat-9 or SAR mosaic used for manual digitisation was downloaded. 
4. QUALITY_FL - A quality flag; a value of 0 indicates relative certainty regarding the digitisation (≤ 25 m), whilst a value of 1 indicates the uncertainty may be greater than 25 m.
